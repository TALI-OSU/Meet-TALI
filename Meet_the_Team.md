# Meet the TALI Team

### Kaitlin Hill
Kaitlin is a Senior at Oregon State University studying Computer Science and Education. She started learning Computer Science in college after enjoying some web development in high school. Her freshman year of programming was quite difficult as she had no previous programming experience. Her first year fueled her interest in Computer Science Education though. She believes that all students are capable of programming and should have the opportunity to learn programming before college. In her spare time, Kaitlin is involved with ACM-W and enjoys running.

### Sharlena Luyen
